# if you want to use ROS across multiple computers, connect them using cable or wireless. Make sure that the machines can ping each other. Decide which one of the machines should be the master and note the ip-address of this computer. Put this IP-address in the snippet below and copy the snipped to the bottom of the .bashrc in your home directory (.bashrc is a script that is called every time you open a new console) at EVERY of the connected computers.

me=$(hostname -I | cut -f1 -d' ')
master=192.168.0.7
echo "setting $master as ROS MASTER for me ($me)"
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$master:11311
export ROS_IP=$me


# run roscore only at the master-computer. Try rostopic list on the other machines. If it worked, you should see:
/rosout
